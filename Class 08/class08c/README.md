## Why Nextjs vs Reactjs
1. Nextjs is a framwork while Reactjs is a library for building web applications
2. You can't build a full stack web app using react but with Nextjs
3. You don't need to install 3rd party package for routing in nextjs like in react its `react-router-dom`, next js is file based router system
4. Nextjs Allows you to create APIs, which enables it as a full stack framework
5. Nextjs supports both server side & client side rendering while reactjs supports only client side rendering (worth mentioning here, in nextjs by default all components are server componets)
